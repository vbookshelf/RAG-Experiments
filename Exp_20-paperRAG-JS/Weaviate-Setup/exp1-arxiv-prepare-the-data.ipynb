on-line shortest path problem under partial monitoring\n  The on-line shortest path problem is considered under various models of\npartial monitoring. Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights\ncan change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in\neach round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the\nloss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing\nedges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed\nbandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the\nweights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an\nalgorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of\nthe best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by\na quantity that is proportional to 1/\\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on\nthe number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear\ncomplexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension\nto the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision\nmaker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen\npath at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the\ndecision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the\nproblem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit\nsetting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns\nonly the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual\nedges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along\nwith simulation results are also presented.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Clean the

Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the loss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing edges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by a quantity that is proportional to 1/\\\\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear complexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension to the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen path at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual edges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along with simulation results are also presented.'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Take a small sample of the data\n# This reduces the cost of vectorizing\n\ndf_sample = df_filtered[0:SAMPLE_SIZE]\n\ndf_sample = df_sample.reset_index(drop=True)\n\nprint(df_sample.shape)\n\ndf_sample.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-16T13:26:47.490619Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-16T13:26:47.491320Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-16T13:26:47.764013Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-16T13:26:47.491273Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-16T13:26:47.762971Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"(259463, 7)\n","output_type":"stream"},{"execution_count":27,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"          id                                              title  \\\n0  0704.1020  The on-line shortest path problem under partia...   \n1  0704.1028    A neural network approach to ordinal regression   \n2  0704.1267  Text Line Segmentation of Historical Documents...   \n3  0704.1274   Parametric Learning and Monte Carlo Optimization   \n4  0704.1394  Calculating Valid Domains for BDD-Based Intera...   \n\n                                            abstract         categories  \\\n0  The on-line shortest path problem is considere...        cs.LG cs.SC   \n1  Ordinal regression is an important type of lea...  cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE   \n2  There is a huge amount of historical documents...              cs.CV   \n3  This paper uncovers and explores the close rel...              cs.LG   \n4  In these notes we formally describe the functi...              cs.AI   \n\n               code_list selected_cats  \\\n0         [cs.LG, cs.SC]           yes   \n1  [cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE]           yes   \n2                [cs.CV]           yes   \n3                [cs.LG]           yes   \n4                [cs.AI]           yes   \n\n                                       prepared_text  \n0  The on-line shortest path problem under partia...  \n1  A neural network approach to ordinal regressio...  \n2  Text Line Segmentation of Historical Documents...  \n3  Parametric Learning and Monte Carlo Optimizati...  \n4  Calculating Valid Domains for BDD-Based Intera...

This mathematical structure captures the effect of superposition of composite prospects, including many incorporated intentions, which allows us to explain a variety of interesting fallacies and anomalies that have been reported to particularize the decision making of real human beings. The theory describes entangled decision making, non-commutativity of subsequent decisions, and intention interference of composite prospects. We demonstrate how the violation of the Savage's sure-thing principle (disjunction effect) can be explained as a result of the interference of intentions, when making decisions under uncertainty. The conjunction fallacy is also explained by the presence of the interference terms. We demonstrate that all known anomalies and paradoxes, documented in the context of classical decision theory, are reducible to just a few mathematical archetypes, all of which finding straightforward explanations in the frame of the developed quantum approach.\",\n                    \"arxiv_id\": \"0808.0112\",\n                    \"title\": \"Mathematical Structure of Quantum Decision Theory\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"_additional\": {\n                        \"distance\": null,\n                        \"id\": \"f74436b5-e4d6-4ae9-9b28-940b2fa1670f\"\n                    },\n                    \"abstract\": \"Modeling the Experience of Emotion {title} Affective computing has proven to be a viable field of research comprised of a large number of multidisciplinary researchers resulting in work that is widely published. The majority of this work consists of computational models of emotion recognition, computational modeling of causal factors of emotion and emotion expression through rendered and robotic faces. A smaller part is concerned with modeling the effects of emotion, formal modeling of cognitive appraisal theory and models of emergent emotions. Part of the motivation for affective computing as a field is to better understand emotional processes through computational modeling. One of the four major topics in affective computing is computers that have emotions (the others are recognizing, expressing and understanding emotions). A critical and neglected aspect of having emotions is the experience of emotion (Barrett, Mesquita, Ochsner, and Gross, 2007): what does the content of an emotional episode look like, how does this content change over time and when do we call the episode emotional. Few modeling efforts have these topics as primary focus.

The theory describes entangled decision making, non-commutativity of subsequent decisions, and intention interference of composite prospects. We demonstrate how the violation of the Savage's sure-thing principle (disjunction effect) can be explained as a result of the interference of intentions, when making decisions under uncertainty. The conjunction fallacy is also explained by the presence of the interference terms.

A smaller part is concerned with modeling the effects of emotion, formal modeling of cognitive appraisal theory and models of emergent emotions. Part of the motivation for affective computing as a field is to better understand emotional processes through computational modeling. One of the four major topics in affective computing is computers that have emotions (the others are recognizing, expressing and understanding emotions). A critical and neglected aspect of having emotions is the experience of emotion (Barrett, Mesquita, Ochsner, and Gross, 2007): what does the content of an emotional episode look like, how does this content change over time and when do we call the episode emotional.
