## Exp_04 - Query a Weaviate vector database using Curl in Javascript

### Objective
- In the previous experiment we set up a small vector database on Weaviate using Python.
- Here we query that database using Curl in Javascript.
- The goal is to learn how to send a curl API request from Javascript.

  
### Notes
- The Weaviate url that needs to be used changes depending on the Curl request that needs to be sent.
- The code for Curl is given in the Weaviate docs. Use ChatGPT to convert this code for use in Javascript.
- This code does not need node.js to work. It's vanilla Javascript that's running in the browser.
