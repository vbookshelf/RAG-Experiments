## Exp_03 - Set up a small vector database on Weaviate (Sandbox)

### Objective
- Use Python (client version 3) to set up a small database on Weaviate
- Learn how to work with that database using Python in a Jupyter notebook

  
### Notes
- All the text properties get vectorized.
- The vectorization is done by the database using OpenAi embeddings.
- The database supports sparse, dense and hybrid search.
- The database also supports multi-lingual search.
- The Generative step can also be done by the database.
