              "{'prepared_text': '{Kaggle Docs: Public API} Interacting with Datasets  The Kaggle API and CLI tool provide easy ways to interact with Datasets on Kaggle. The commands available can make searching for and downloading Kaggle Datasets a seamless part of your data science workflow.  If you haven’t installed the Kaggle Python package needed to use the command line tool or generated an API token, check out the getting started steps first.  Some of the commands for interacting with Datasets via CLI include:  - kaggle datasets list -s [KEYWORD]: list datasets matching a search term - kaggle datasets download -d [DATASET]: download files associated with a dataset  If you are creating or updating a dataset on Kaggle, you can also use the API to make maintenance convenient or even programmatic. View all available commands on the official documentation on GitHub and keep up-to-date with the latest features and bug fixes in the changelog.  To explore additional CLI arguments, remember that you can always append -h after any call to see the help menu for that command.  Other than the Kaggle API, there is also a Kaggle connector on DataStudio! You can select Kaggle Datasets as a data source to import directly into DataStudio. Work in DataStudio to easily create beautiful and effective dashboards on Kaggle Datasets!  Creating and Maintaining Datasets The Kaggle API can be used to to create new Datasets and Dataset versions on Kaggle from the comfort of the command-line. This can make sharing data and projects on Kaggle a simple part of your workflow. You can even use the API plus a tool like crontab to schedule programmatic updates of your Datasets to keep them well maintained.  If you haven’t installed the Kaggle Python package needed to use the command line tool or generated an API token, check out the getting started steps first.  Create a New Dataset Here are the steps you can follow to create a new dataset on Kaggle:  - Create a folder containing the files you want to upload - Run kaggle datasets init -p /path/to/dataset to generate a metadata file - Add your dataset’s metadata to the generated file, datapackage.json - Run kaggle datasets create -p /path/to/dataset to create the dataset  Your dataset will be private by default. You can also add a -u flag to make it public when you create it, or navigate to “Settings” > “Sharing” from your dataset’s page to make it public or share with collaborators.  Create a New Dataset Version If you’d like to upload a new version of an existing dataset, follow these steps:  - Run kaggle datasets init -p /path/to/dataset to generate a metadata file (if you don’t already have one) - Make sure the id field in dataset-metadata.json (or datapackage.json) points to your dataset - Run kaggle datasets version -p /path/to/dataset -m \"Your message here\"  These instructions are the basic commands required to get started with creating and updating Datasets on Kaggle. You can find out more details from the official documentation on GitHub: - Initializing metadata - Create a Dataset - Update a Dataset  Working with Dataset Metadata If you want a faster way to complete the required dataset-metadata.json file (for example, if you want to add column-level descriptions for many tabular data files), we recommend using Frictionless Data’s Data Package Creator. Simply upload the dataset-metadata.json file that you’ve initialized for your dataset, fill out metadata in the user interface, and download the result.  To explore some further CLI arguments, remember that you can always append -h after any call to see the help menu for that command.'}"

Lessons within a track are separated into easily digestible chunks and contain Notebook exercises for you to practise building models and new techniques hands-on. It is a great way to start deep diving into data science and quickly get familiar with the field!  What Kaggle has learned from almost 2MM machine learning models on Youtube. This data.bythebay.io talk by Kaggle founder Anthony Goldbloom lays out what Kaggle competitions are all about.  How to (almost) win at Kaggle on Youtube. In this talk competitor Kiri Nichols summarizes the appeal of Competitions as a data science learner.  Discussion  General Discussion: There are six general site Discussion Forums: - Kaggle Forum: Events and topics specific to the Kaggle community - Getting Started: The first stop for questions and discussion for new Kagglers - Product Feedback: Tell us what you love, hate, or wish for - Questions & Answers: Technical advice from other data scientists - Datasets: Requests for and discussion of open data - Learn: Questions, answers, and requests related to Kaggle Learn courses  Competition Discussion Forums: No matter the competition you are participating in, you can count on plenty of active community members making posts to the forums. If you get stuck on a particular aspect of the problem, Discussions are a great place to ask questions.  Competition Notebooks: Similar to Discussions, Notebooks shared within a competition are an excellent source of Exploratory Data Analyses (EDAs) & basic starter models which can be forked and built upon for applied learning.  The Kaggle Noobs Slack channel: This Slack channel is a popular watering hole for general banter among Kaggle ML practitioners from Novice to Grandmaster.  Techniques Public, reproducible code examples in Notebooks are a great way to learn and put to practice new techniques. Search for techniques in Notebooks by tag using the search syntax tag:classification. Fork Notebooks to make a copy of the code to modify and experiment with.  The No Free Hunch blog. No Free Hunch is a great way of keeping up with goings-on on Kaggle. Many past Competitions winners have been interviewed about and presented their winning models on No Free Hunch. Here are some examples of past winner\\u2019s interviews:  - NOAA Right Whale Identification - Instacart Market Basket Analysis, Winner\\u2019s Interview: 2nd place, Kazuki Onodera - Two Sigma Financial Modeling Code Competition  Various tutorials have been published on No Free Hunch:  - An Intuitive Introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks - Introduction To Neural Networks - A Kaggle Master Explains Gradient Boosting - A Kaggler\\u2019s Guide to Model Stacking in Practice - Marios Michailidis: How to become a Kaggle #1: An introduction to model stacking: In this Data Science Festival talk top Kaggler Marios Michailidis (Kasanova) explains model stacking, a key feature of winning competition models, in great detail. - Kaggle Grandmaster Panel: A panel Q&A from H2O World 2017 featuring some top Kagglers. - How to Win A Kaggle Competition - Learn From Top Kagglers: This Coursera course, put together by high-ranking Kagglers, going into great detail on the tools and techniques used by winning Competitions models.\"\n",

For example, in the Store Sales \\u2013 Time Series Forecasting competition, participants must accurately predict how many of each grocery item will sell using a dataset of past product and sales information from a grocery retailer.  Once the competition starts participants can submit their predictions, Kaggle will score them for accuracy, and the team will be placed on a ranked leaderboard. The team at the top of the leaderboard at the deadline wins!  Datasets, Submissions & Leaderboards Every competition\\u2019s dataset is split into two smaller datasets.  One of these smaller datasets will be given to participants to train their models, typically named train.csv.  The other dataset will be mostly hidden from participants and used by Kaggle for testing and scoring, named test.csv and solution.csv (test.csv is the same as solution.csv except that test.csv contains the feature values and solution.csv contains the ground truth variable(s) \\u2013 participants will never, ever see solution.csv ).  When a participant feels ready to make a submission to the competition, they will use test.csv to generate a prediction and upload a CSV file. Kaggle will automatically score the submission for accuracy using the hidden solution.csv file.  Most competitions have a maximum number of submissions that a participant can make each day and a final deadline at which point the leaderboard will be frozen.  It\\u2019s conceivable that a participant could use the mechanics of a Kaggle competition to overfit a solution - which would be great for winning a competition, but not valuable for a real-world application.  To help prevent this, Kaggle has two leaderboards \\u2013 the public and private leaderboard. The competition host splits the solution.csv dataset into two parts, using one part for the public leaderboard and another part for the private leaderboard. Participants generally will now know which samples are public vs private. The private leaderboard is kept a secret until after the competition deadline and is used as the official leaderboard for determining the final ranking.\"\n",

The Competition leaderboard has two parts.  The public leaderboard provides publicly visible submission scores based on a representative sample of the test data. This leaderboard is visible throughout the competition.  The private leaderboard, by contrast, tracks model performance using the remainder of the test data. The private leaderboard thus has final say on whose models are best, and hence, who the winners and losers of the Competition will be. Which subset of data is calculated on the private leaderboard or a submission\\u2019s performance on the private leaderboard is not released to users until the competition has been closed.  Many users watch the public leaderboard closely, as breakthroughs in the competition are announced by score gains in the leaderboard. These jumps in turn motivate other teams working on the competition in search of those advancements. But it\\u2019s important to keep the public leaderboard in perspective. It\\u2019s very easy to overfit a model, creating something that performs very well on the public leaderboard, but very badly on the private one. This is called overfitting.  In the event of an exact score tie, the tiebreaker is the team which submitted earlier. Kaggle always uses full precision when determining rankings, not just the truncated precision shown on the Leaderboard.\"\n",

Lessons within a track are separated into easily digestible chunks and contain Notebook exercises for you to practise building models and new techniques hands-on. It is a great way to start deep diving into data science and quickly get familiar with the field!  What Kaggle has learned from almost 2MM machine learning models on Youtube. This data.bythebay.io talk by Kaggle founder Anthony Goldbloom lays out what Kaggle competitions are all about.  How to (almost) win at Kaggle on Youtube. In this talk competitor Kiri Nichols summarizes the appeal of Competitions as a data science learner.  Discussion  General Discussion: There are six general site Discussion Forums: - Kaggle Forum: Events and topics specific to the Kaggle community - Getting Started: The first stop for questions and discussion for new Kagglers - Product Feedback: Tell us what you love, hate, or wish for - Questions & Answers: Technical advice from other data scientists - Datasets: Requests for and discussion of open data - Learn: Questions, answers, and requests related to Kaggle Learn courses  Competition Discussion Forums: No matter the competition you are participating in, you can count on plenty of active community members making posts to the forums. If you get stuck on a particular aspect of the problem, Discussions are a great place to ask questions.  Competition Notebooks: Similar to Discussions, Notebooks shared within a competition are an excellent source of Exploratory Data Analyses (EDAs) & basic starter models which can be forked and built upon for applied learning.  The Kaggle Noobs Slack channel: This Slack channel is a popular watering hole for general banter among Kaggle ML practitioners from Novice to Grandmaster.  Techniques Public, reproducible code examples in Notebooks are a great way to learn and put to practice new techniques. Search for techniques in Notebooks by tag using the search syntax tag:classification. Fork Notebooks to make a copy of the code to modify and experiment with.  The No Free Hunch blog. No Free Hunch is a great way of keeping up with goings-on on Kaggle. Many past Competitions winners have been interviewed about and presented their winning models on No Free Hunch. Here are some examples of past winner\\u2019s interviews:  - NOAA Right Whale Identification - Instacart Market Basket Analysis, Winner\\u2019s Interview: 2nd place, Kazuki Onodera - Two Sigma Financial Modeling Code Competition  Various tutorials have been published on No Free Hunch:  - An Intuitive Introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks - Introduction To Neural Networks - A Kaggle Master Explains Gradient Boosting - A Kaggler\\u2019s Guide to Model Stacking in Practice - Marios Michailidis: How to become a Kaggle #1: An introduction to model stacking: In this Data Science Festival talk top Kaggler Marios Michailidis (Kasanova) explains model stacking, a key feature of winning competition models, in great detail. - Kaggle Grandmaster Panel: A panel Q&A from H2O World 2017 featuring some top Kagglers. - How to Win A Kaggle Competition - Learn From Top Kagglers: This Coursera course, put together by high-ranking Kagglers, going into great detail on the tools and techniques used by winning Competitions models.\"\n",

In our example above, the title \\u201cStore Sales - Time Series Forecasting\\u201d quickly outlines the type of data, the industry of the dataset, and the type of problem to be solved.  If you want to create a competition with more privacy, you can limit your competition's visibility and restrict who can join on this page.  Visibility: Competitions with their visibility set to public are viewable on Kaggle and appear in Kaggle search results. Competitions with visibility set to private are hidden and only accessible via invitation URLs from the host.  Who Can Join: Competitions access can be set to three levels: anyone, only people with a link and restricted email list. If you select anyone, all Kagglers can join your competition. Selecting only people with a link, will restrict access to those users you provide a special URL. Finally, restricted email list is the most private competition. Only Kagglers with accounts that match the emails or email domains you specify will be able to join. Note: if you select restricted email list, notebooks will be turned off. This provides a way to ensure that any private data that you have in a competition is not accidentally leaked through shared notebooks. You can choose to re-enable notebooks if you choose.

It is a great way to start deep diving into data science and quickly get familiar with the field!  What Kaggle has learned from almost 2MM machine learning models on Youtube. This data.bythebay.io talk by Kaggle founder Anthony Goldbloom lays out what Kaggle competitions are all about.  How to (almost) win at Kaggle on Youtube. In this talk competitor Kiri Nichols summarizes the appeal of Competitions as a data science learner.  Discussion  General Discussion: There are six general site Discussion Forums: - Kaggle Forum: Events and topics specific to the Kaggle community - Getting Started: The first stop for questions and discussion for new Kagglers - Product Feedback: Tell us what you love, hate, or wish for - Questions & Answers: Technical advice from other data scientists - Datasets: Requests for and discussion of open data - Learn: Questions, answers, and requests related to Kaggle Learn courses  Competition Discussion Forums: No matter the competition you are participating in, you can count on plenty of active community members making posts to the forums. If you get stuck on a particular aspect of the problem, Discussions are a great place to ask questions.  Competition Notebooks: Similar to Discussions, Notebooks shared within a competition are an excellent source of Exploratory Data Analyses (EDAs) & basic starter models which can be forked and built upon for applied learning.  The Kaggle Noobs Slack channel: This Slack channel is a popular watering hole for general banter among Kaggle ML practitioners from Novice to Grandmaster.  Techniques Public, reproducible code examples in Notebooks are a great way to learn and put to practice new techniques. Search for techniques in Notebooks by tag using the search syntax tag:classification. Fork Notebooks to make a copy of the code to modify and experiment with.  The No Free Hunch blog. No Free Hunch is a great way of keeping up with goings-on on Kaggle. Many past Competitions winners have been interviewed about and presented their winning models on No Free Hunch. Here are some examples of past winner\\u2019s interviews:  - NOAA Right Whale Identification - Instacart Market Basket Analysis, Winner\\u2019s Interview: 2nd place, Kazuki Onodera - Two Sigma Financial Modeling Code Competition  Various tutorials have been published on No Free Hunch:  - An Intuitive Introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks - Introduction To Neural Networks - A Kaggle Master Explains Gradient Boosting - A Kaggler\\u2019s Guide to Model Stacking in Practice - Marios Michailidis: How to become a Kaggle #1: An introduction to model stacking: In this Data Science Festival talk top Kaggler Marios Michailidis (Kasanova) explains model stacking, a key feature of winning competition models, in great detail. - Kaggle Grandmaster Panel: A panel Q&A from H2O World 2017 featuring some top Kagglers. - How to Win A Kaggle Competition - Learn From Top Kagglers: This Coursera course, put together by high-ranking Kagglers, going into great detail on the tools and techniques used by winning Competitions models.\"\n",

The Competition leaderboard has two parts.  The public leaderboard provides publicly visible submission scores based on a representative sample of the test data. This leaderboard is visible throughout the competition.  The private leaderboard, by contrast, tracks model performance using the remainder of the test data. The private leaderboard thus has final say on whose models are best, and hence, who the winners and losers of the Competition will be. Which subset of data is calculated on the private leaderboard or a submission\\u2019s performance on the private leaderboard is not released to users until the competition has been closed.  Many users watch the public leaderboard closely, as breakthroughs in the competition are announced by score gains in the leaderboard. These jumps in turn motivate other teams working on the competition in search of those advancements. But it\\u2019s important to keep the public leaderboard in perspective. It\\u2019s very easy to overfit a model, creating something that performs very well on the public leaderboard, but very badly on the private one. This is called overfitting.  In the event of an exact score tie, the tiebreaker is the team which submitted earlier. Kaggle always uses full precision when determining rankings, not just the truncated precision shown on the Leaderboard.\"\n",

Then, enter a descriptive title, subtitle and URL for your competition. Be as descriptive and to the point as possible. In our example above, the title \\u201cStore Sales - Time Series Forecasting\\u201d quickly outlines the type of data, the industry of the dataset, and the type of problem to be solved.  If you want to create a competition with more privacy, you can limit your competition's visibility and restrict who can join on this page.  Visibility: Competitions with their visibility set to public are viewable on Kaggle and appear in Kaggle search results. Competitions with visibility set to private are hidden and only accessible via invitation URLs from the host.  Who Can Join: Competitions access can be set to three levels: anyone, only people with a link and restricted email list. If you select anyone, all Kagglers can join your competition. Selecting only people with a link, will restrict access to those users you provide a special URL. Finally, restricted email list is the most private competition. Only Kagglers with accounts that match the emails or email domains you specify will be able to join. Note: if you select restricted email list, notebooks will be turned off. This provides a way to ensure that any private data that you have in a competition is not accidentally leaked through shared notebooks. You can choose to re-enable notebooks if you choose.  Review and accept our terms of service, then click \\u201cCreate Competition\\u201d.  Your competition listing is now in draft mode.
