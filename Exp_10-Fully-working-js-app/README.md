## Exp_10 - Build a fully working RAG Javascript web app

### Objective
- Get all RAG steps working
- Set up a working user web interface

### Notes
- Everything works.
- Each step now needs to be optimized.
- The hybrid search is producing duplicate text in it's predictions. This needs to be fixed.
- The OpenAi response can be slow at times.
